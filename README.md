# js_scorecard_app
Basic single-page JS app using MEAN stack

To try this out for yourself you will need the following.

1. Mongo: To install Mongo reference the instalation guides here https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community. 

2. Node: If you don't have Node go to https://nodejs.org and download it via the install button on the site. 

3. Express: To install Express simply run the following command in the terminal:
`npm install -g express-generator`

If you clone down the repo, be sure you do all of the folliwing:

1: To install the dependencies, go back into the Terminal or Command Prompt and run the following commands:
`npm install`

2: Run your mongo server using the command 
  `mongod`

3: In a separate terminal tab start your server using the command
  `nodemon`
  
  Once the server is running you should load a page that looks like this, just without any current scores.
